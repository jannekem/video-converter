# Video Converter

This is a ffmpeg wrapper for converting video files between .mkv and .mp4 formats.

## Usage

To make the application work first you'll need to have ffmpeg installed and available in the path. Then install the requirements to a virtual environment or globally and run with `python converter.py`.

This project uses [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) for the GUI and [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) for interfacing with ffmpeg.

## About

This is also an example project for my blog post [Creating simple Python applications with Gooey](https://pakstech.com/blog/python-gooey/).
